# HTB Academy Writeups

## About

This contains the writeups for the skills assessment for the modules in HTB Academy.

I am currently learning more about cybersecurity through HTB Academy, follow me through my learning journey as I document my thought process and how I solved the various labs in the modules.

I used HTB Academy's web based Pwnbox (Parrot Linux) to complete the labs in the modules

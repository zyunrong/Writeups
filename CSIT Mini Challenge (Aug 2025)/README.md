# CSIT Mini Challenge
This is my writeups for the solutions to the software engineering and cyber security mini challenge (CTF) organised by CSIT

## About

```
The fireworks are prepped and the crowd is waiting. Beneath the surface, however, something’s not quite right. A system built to support the celebration has been infiltrated.

As the city prepares to look to the skies, you’ve been called to look into the shadows.

Step into a fictional cybersecurity challenge inspired by the spirit of National Day — and see if you can capture the flag! 
```

## Instructions
```
1. Navigate Challenges

Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between challenges. Challenge 1 will be unlocked after you complete this set of instructions. Click on the challenge tab to begin. Challenges will be unlocked sequentially after you complete the preceding ones.

2. Read & Analyze

Each challenge tab contains instructions, hints, and resources needed to capture the flag. Look carefully for unusual features on the page. Tip: even the tiniest and faintest things on the page may provide a hint.

3. Submit Flags

Flags are in the format of "CSIT{actual_flag}". Enter the full string and press submit to check.

4. Track Progress

Watch the colored circles at the bottom-right. They light up as you complete each challenge. Successfully completed challenge tabs will be marked as "Completed" on the top left. Wrong answers make the input shake - just try again!

5. Make sure to save a local copy of the flags and have fun!
